## Seq2Seq Model
The Seq2Seq model employed in QuestionPro utilizes a powerful sequence-to-sequence architecture to generate questions from provided contexts. This model, rooted in deep learning and natural language processing, excels at understanding and transforming input sequences into meaningful output sequences.

With Seq2Seq, the task of question generation becomes dynamic and context-aware. The model is capable of capturing intricate relationships within a given context and translating them into well-structured questions. By leveraging the inherent sequential nature of language, Seq2Seq enhances the precision and relevance of the generated questions.
